The Problem: 

There is a huge problem in South Africa where the people don't have the needed skills to be able to find work. 
Even though a lot of people are willing to learn, they don't know what skills are in demand or where one can learn them.

The Solution:

The solution is simple. Create a platform where users
can see the skills that are in demand, learn them and then get jobs. 

This is a convenient solution to two problems: 

A way for job seekers to learn skills needed to find jobs,
A way for job providers to build a custom job with a profile consisting of multiple skills.
